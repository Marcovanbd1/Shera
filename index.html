      <h2>The moment the system cannot hear</h2>
      <p>Not at appointments. Not at referrals. Not at records.</p>
      <p>
        But before any of that. The moment when someone notices something is wrong, but does not yet know what to do.
        They hesitate, minimise, loop, delay, and tell themselves they are not “bad enough yet”.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        This is the most common starting point for harm, escalation, and inequality in the NHS, and it is structurally invisible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Most health and care systems are designed to respond after a person has already decided what the problem is,
        how serious it is, who to contact, and how to navigate the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        But uncertainty is not organised, and vulnerability does not arrive with a referral code.
        People who are less confident, less digitally fluent, less socially supported, more traumatised, more isolated,
        or more marginalised are far more likely to get lost here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where inequity begins. This is where demand silently builds. This is where harm quietly accumulates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What Neighbourhood Signals is</h2>
      <p>
        Neighbourhood Signals is a new layer of neighbourhood-level listening and navigation infrastructure.
        It sits before appointments, referrals, and records.
      </p>
      <p>
        It listens for early signs of uncertainty, confusion, and unmet need across a neighbourhood,
        using lightweight behavioural signals from everyday digital spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        It then turns what it hears into simple, human next steps people can actually use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not clinical triage. Not diagnosis. Not automation.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        It is a safety and equity layer that makes it easier to find support than to stay confused.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Two connected parts</h2>

      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1. Neighbourhood-level listening</h3>
          <p>
            Small, privacy-safe digital signals are used to understand what a neighbourhood is quietly struggling with.
            This does not track individuals. It listens to patterns.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            Rising searches about food. Spikes in mental health uncertainty. Repeated late-night loops around the same pages.
            Sudden increases in crisis-related browsing.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            These patterns reveal unmet need long before it shows up in clinical demand, allowing neighbourhood teams to respond earlier,
            more proportionately, and more safely.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>2. Human navigation (Support Playlists)</h3>
          <p>
            For individuals, the system provides simple, calm, human next steps. We call these Support Playlists.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            They are not directories. They are not search results. They are small, curated, locally grounded sets of support options
            shaped around what someone is actually experiencing.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:10px;">
            They are designed to reduce cognitive load, fear, and decision paralysis at the point where people most need steadiness.
          </p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How the AI is used</h2>
      <p>
        This is not a conversation. The AI does not diagnose, generate medical advice, or make decisions about people.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use the model for what it is genuinely good at, understanding messy, unstructured language and recognising the shape of someone’s situation.
        It then matches that to a controlled, curated set of trusted support routes.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        The AI interprets. The system retrieves. The person chooses.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this is safer than what we currently do</h2>
      <p>
        Current systems assume clarity at the moment of contact. They expect people, at their most uncertain, to act with certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neighbourhood Signals reverses this. It recognises uncertainty as a safety signal, not a user failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not push people into rigid pathways. It does not automate decisions about them. It does not extract clinical data.
        It provides gentle, proportionate navigation before clinical escalation is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        This reduces inappropriate appointments, avoidable crises, hidden demand, and harm.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this matters for equity</h2>
      <p>
        The people most likely to struggle at the uncertainty edge are also the people most likely to experience poorer outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This includes people experiencing trauma, people living in poverty, digitally excluded groups, marginalised communities,
        those with limited social support, and people living with long-term stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        By making early navigation easier, calmer, and more human, Neighbourhood Signals reduces structural disadvantage before it compounds.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        Equity is not a downstream adjustment here. It is built into where the system begins to listen.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What this is not</h2>
      <p>
        It is not an EPR module. It is not an AI triage engine. It is not a chatbot. It is not a front door replacement.
        It does not replace clinical judgement.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        It is a neighbourhood safety layer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How it fits into the NHS</h2>
      <p>
        Neighbourhood Signals works alongside Primary Care Networks, Integrated Neighbourhood Teams, community services,
        VCSE organisations, and population health teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides early insight into rising neighbourhood needs, proportionate navigation before clinical escalation,
        safer pathways into support, and a shared language of unmet need.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can connect into existing systems where appropriate, but it does not depend on them to be safe or effective.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this matters now</h2>
      <p>Demand is rising. Complexity is rising. Digital inequality is rising. Clinical capacity is finite.</p>
      <p>But uncertainty is rising faster than any of these.</p>
      <p>
        Neighbourhood Signals allows neighbourhoods to listen earlier, respond earlier, and prevent harm earlier.
        It turns websites into sensors, clicks into stories of need, and uncertainty into safer next steps.
